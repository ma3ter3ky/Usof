## CBL Log

### Engage
- Big Idea: knowledge and experience exchange.
- Essential Question: How to help people exchange knowledge?
- Challenge: build a backend API for a Q&A system (StackOverflow-like).

### Investigate
- Read the PDF requirements carefully.
- Analyzed what technologies and patterns are required: JS, Node.js, Express, MySQL, MVC, OOP/SOLID, role-based access, admin panel, informative error handling.

### Act: Basic (Hour 1)
- Initialized local Git repo and connected to GitHub.
- Created `README.md` skeleton and `/docs` folder with files: `architecture.md`, `database.md`, `endpoints.md`, `errors.md`, `cbl.md`.
- Added a draft `openapi.yaml` with minimal structure (contract-first approach).
- Fixed PDF requirements into the `README.md`.
- Applied 12-factor principle: planned `.env` files (no secrets in git).
- Planned first 10 hours roadmap (kept notes in Notion).

**Result:** Repo with minimal docs, `/docs` folder and `openapi.yaml` skeleton created. Ready to proceed to environment and linting setup (Hour 2).
